      <h3>C Programming - Academic & Practical</h3>
      <p>I'm currently learning C programming at the University of Guelph as part of my Computer Science degree. I apply what I learn through hands-on projects, working with pointers, structs, and file operations.
        Some of my recent C projects include a music playlist manager using linked lists, handling binary file data, and writing low-level code for Raspberry Pi GPIO control. These experiences have helped me strengthen my understanding of systems programming and embedded development.</p>
